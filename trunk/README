Requirements:
=============

Mandatory:

C compiler

Optional:

pkg-config
gtk+-2.0 + gdk-pixbuf + development files


Building:
=========

One-time build:
    make all

To build without the GTK+-2.0 GUI, type:
    make hmgen

Developer build:
    make dep verbose
    or
    make dep hmgen-verbose
    etc...

Clean up:
    make clean

Cleaner up:
    make distclean
    make mrproper

The default target is linux-gcc. To change that, use:
    make TARGET=linux-suncc all

Porting to another target can be done by adding it to target.mak.

Yeah, I am too lazy to copy & paste & adjust a proper configure script.
Send a patch if you want. I will not accept any autotools stuff though.
